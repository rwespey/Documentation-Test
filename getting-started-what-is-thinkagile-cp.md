# What is ThinkAgile CP?

ThinkAgile CP is a private cloud software platform, purpose-built to deliver a full-fledged, all-in-one cloud infrastructure that is ready for use out of the box. With a premium implementation, deployment, operations, and management experience, ThinkAgile CP is easy, powerful, and able to accelerate your applications — supporting business initiatives and better outcomes. The platform operates free of any hardware-specific dependencies and is programmatically extensible.

## How do I purchase it?

ThinkAgile CP is sold either directly, through an OEM partner or a CSP/MSP. It is sold as a complete platform and includes all pre-validated application templates in the Lenovo Cloud Marketplace, the web-based Cloud Controller, networking, storage and compute blocks. The platform includes an API for the creation and re-factoring of applications so they can be made cloud-native, or you can also use your own licensed products.

-   **[How does ThinkAgile CP work?](getting-started-how-does-it-work.md)**  
The ThinkAgile CP was designed to simplify implementation, deployment, operations, and maintenance of cloud resources, enabling IT staff to be innovative and to accelerate your business' time-to-market and time-to-value.
-   **[What can I do with ThinkAgile CP?](getting-started-what-can-do.md)**  
Unlike any other cloud, ThinkAgile CP has been designed from the ground up. It is a great fit for organizations that need to use private cloud for digital transformation initiatives, or as a platform to repatriate workloads from public cloud due to performance needs or data compliance and security concerns.
-   **[How is ThinkAgile CP deployed? How do I access and use it?](getting-started-how-cp-deployed.md)**  
ThinkAgile CP works with you to collect site survey information and then ship the platform on-site, ready for a certified technician to perform a white-glove deployment. The physical delivery, implementation, and deployment take less than a day; and, the actual system setup takes less than an hour. The necessary datacenter connectivity information needs to be collected prior to installation to avoid any delays in deployment.
-   **[ThinkAgile CP4000 Series Overview](starter_series_introduction.md)**  
The Lenovo ThinkAgile CP4000 Series scales as an initial data-management footprint for managed service provider and cloud service provider environments that start on a smaller scale but are poised for growth. The CP4000 Series also supports business continuity when deployed remotely as an off-site backup for disaster recovery.
-   **[ThinkAgile CP6000 Series Overview](enterprise_series_introduction.md)**  
The Lenovo ThinkAgile CP6000 Series offering can be scaled up to 40 compute nodes to support mainstream enterprise workloads and mixed-workload environments.
-   **[ThinkAgile CP Product Components](getting-started-product-components.md)**  
ThinkAgile CP is a private cloud platform, purpose-built to deliver a all-inclusive cloud infrastructure that is ready for use out of the box. With a premium implementation, deployment, operations, and management experience, ThinkAgile CP is easy, powerful, and able to accelerate your applications—supporting business initiatives and better outcomes. The platform operates free of any hardware-specific dependencies, and it is composable, disaggregated, and programmatically extensible.
-   **[Key Product Concepts](getting-started-key-product-concepts.md)**  
ThinkAgile CP provides access to the virtual representations of your tightly integrated compute, storage, and network hardware components in the cloud and enables you to provision, manage, and control your hardware. You easily and securely connect to the ThinkAgile CP Cloud Controller Web Portal by logging in with two-factor authentication; you do not connect to the hardware stack directly, only to the controller.
