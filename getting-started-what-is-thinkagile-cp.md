# What is ThinkAgile CP?

With a premium implementation, deployment, operations, and management experience, ThinkAgile CP is easy, powerful, and able to accelerate your applications — supporting business initiatives and better outcomes. The platform operates free of any hardware-specific dependencies and is programmatically extensible.

## How do I purchase it?

ThinkAgile CP is sold either directly, through an OEM partner or a CSP/MSP. It is sold as a complete platform and includes all pre-validated application templates in the Lenovo Cloud Marketplace, the web-based Cloud Controller, networking, storage and compute blocks. The platform includes an API for the creation and re-factoring of applications so they can be made cloud-native, or you can also use your own licensed products.

-   **[How does ThinkAgile CP work?](getting-started-how-does-it-work.md)**  
The ThinkAgile CP was designed to simplify implementation, deployment, operations, and maintenance of cloud resources, enabling IT staff to be innovative and to accelerate your business' time-to-market and time-to-value.
-   **[What can I do with ThinkAgile CP?](getting-started-what-can-do.md)**  
Unlike any other cloud, ThinkAgile CP has been designed from the ground up. It is a great fit for organizations that need to use private cloud for digital transformation initiatives, or as a platform to repatriate workloads from public cloud due to performance needs or data compliance and security concerns.
-   **[How is ThinkAgile CP deployed? How do I access and use it?](getting-started-how-cp-deployed.md)**  
ThinkAgile CP works with you to collect site survey information and then ship the platform on-site, ready for a certified technician to perform a white-glove deployment. The physical delivery, implementation, and deployment take less than a day; and, the actual system setup takes less than an hour. The necessary datacenter connectivity information needs to be collected prior to installation to avoid any delays in deployment.
-   **[ThinkAgile CP4000 Series Overview](starter_series_introduction.md)**  
The Lenovo ThinkAgile CP4000 Series scales as an initial data-management footprint for managed service provider and cloud service provider environments that start on a smaller scale but are poised for growth. The CP4000 Series also supports business continuity when deployed remotely as an off-site backup for disaster recovery.
-   **[ThinkAgile CP6000 Series Overview](enterprise_series_introduction.md)**  
The Lenovo ThinkAgile CP6000 Series offering can be scaled up to 40 compute nodes to support mainstream enterprise workloads and mixed-workload environments.
-   **[ThinkAgile CP Product Components](getting-started-product-components.md)**  
ThinkAgile CP is a private cloud platform, purpose-built to deliver a all-inclusive cloud infrastructure that is ready for use out of the box. With a premium implementation, deployment, operations, and management experience, ThinkAgile CP is easy, powerful, and able to accelerate your applications—supporting business initiatives and better outcomes. The platform operates free of any hardware-specific dependencies, and it is composable, disaggregated, and programmatically extensible.
-   **[Key Product Concepts](getting-started-key-product-concepts.md)**  
ThinkAgile CP provides access to the virtual representations of your tightly integrated compute, storage, and network hardware components in the cloud and enables you to provision, manage, and control your hardware. You easily and securely connect to the ThinkAgile CP Cloud Controller Web Portal by logging in with two-factor authentication; you do not connect to the hardware stack directly, only to the controller.

## How does ThinkAgile CP work?

The ThinkAgile CP was designed to simplify implementation, deployment, operations, and maintenance of cloud resources, enabling IT staff to be innovative and to accelerate your business' time-to-market and time-to-value.

We have incorporated the advantages of public, private and hybrid cloud models into one software appliance, and the platform is comprised of the following software defined components:

-   Networking
-   Compute
-   Storage
-   Cloud Controller

The ThinkAgile CP hardware is completely cloud-managed, via the Cloud Controller, which makes it easy to build, manage, and monitor your cloud from any Web browser. Once you have connected and installed the tightly integrated hardware components, you use the Cloud Controller to provision, manage, and control your hardware. When the units are powered on, Cloud Controller automatically detects and enables high-speed connectivity between them. You can then create and manage virtual datacenters and related applications.

Because it is a "composable" platform, ThinkAgile CP grows easily and cost-effectively. Compute and storage hardware are separate nodes in the platform, so you only need to purchase and add resources as needed. Since there is nothing to configure on-site, and the ThinkAgile CP Cloud Controller automatically detects new resources, adding new compute, storage, and network resources takes seconds. ThinkAgile CP can scale network, compute, and storage resources independently as your application demands change in real time and without downtime.

## What can I do with ThinkAgile CP?

Unlike any other cloud, ThinkAgile CP has been designed from the ground up. It is a great fit for organizations that need to use private cloud for digital transformation initiatives, or as a platform to repatriate workloads from public cloud due to performance needs or data compliance and security concerns.

The aim of ThinkAgile CP is to give organizations the ability to accelerate digital transformation with a private cloud infrastructure that is easy to implement, deploy, operate and maintain—with predictable performance and costs. Example solutions include:

-   **Faster cloud virtualization** - On-premises virtualization platforms do not have to be complex. ThinkAgile CP delivers applications in minutes, not hours or days, so you can focus on the application, not infrastructure.

-   **Actionable insights with big data applications** - ThinkAgile CP delivers an agile, high performance platform with pre-packaged big data applications to simplify adoption and shorten time-to-market.

-   **Database workloads support** - The unique ThinkAgile CP architecture composes and delivers raw system resources with the least amount of latency via all-flash storage, non-blocking network, and our cluster-less design, removing bottlenecks and delivering a high-performance platform.

-   **Delivery of cloud services for managed service providers** - ThinkAgile CP is built with the attributes of the public cloud, including multi-tenancy, micro-segmentation, and self-service, and can be manipulated via an API, allowing service providers to deliver unique cloud services to their customers.

-   **Ready-to-use container technology templates to jump start digital transformation** - ThinkAgile CP delivers an agile, composable platform with the ability to be API-driven to support DevOps practices, such as on-premises infrastructure for Docker, that works out- of-the-box.

-   **Simplified support of remote offices** - ThinkAgile CP offers the same enterprise features, functionality, and performance regardless of the size and location of your business — all managed and orchestrated under one SaaS-based management interface.


The list is really endless: ThinkAgile CP provides the platform and flexibility for you to do what you want and be as creative as you want. The software-defined network, storage, compute, and virtualization platform enables your applications to deliver capabilities based on your current and changing business and technology needs.
