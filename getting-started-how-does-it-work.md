# How does ThinkAgile CP work?

The ThinkAgile CP was designed to simplify implementation, deployment, operations, and maintenance of cloud resources, enabling IT staff to be innovative and to accelerate your business' time-to-market and time-to-value.

We have incorporated the advantages of public, private and hybrid cloud models into one software appliance, and the platform is comprised of the following software defined components:

-   Networking
-   Compute
-   Storage
-   Cloud Controller

The ThinkAgile CP hardware is completely cloud-managed, via the Cloud Controller, which makes it easy to build, manage, and monitor your cloud from any Web browser. Once you have connected and installed the tightly integrated hardware components, you use the Cloud Controller to provision, manage, and control your hardware. When the units are powered on, Cloud Controller automatically detects and enables high-speed connectivity between them. You can then create and manage virtual datacenters and related applications.

Because it is a "composable" platform, ThinkAgile CP grows easily and cost-effectively. Compute and storage hardware are separate nodes in the platform, so you only need to purchase and add resources as needed. Since there is nothing to configure on-site, and the ThinkAgile CP Cloud Controller automatically detects new resources, adding new compute, storage, and network resources takes seconds. ThinkAgile CP can scale network, compute, and storage resources independently as your application demands change in real time and without downtime.
